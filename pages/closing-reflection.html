	<h3>Closing Reflection</h3>
	<p>Through my experiences in English 250, I have better ascertained both my strengths and weaknesses in the different modes of communication. With the benefits in further developing my strengths as well as shoring my weakness, I have constructed plans for improvement in both areas.<br>
	<br>
	While the areas of visual and electronic communication are strengths for me, there are many opportunities for improvement. With many creative tools available to me, I haven’t yet achieved a proficiency where using these tools don’t incur a significant time penalty. Although, there are many future applications which could take advantage of these skills, including presentation materials, posters, charts, graphs, and documents. The benefits of continuing improvement in visual and electronic communication are more expression, improved aesthetics, and ability to create source materials (icons, photos, videos, charts) instead of obtaining licensed or credited outside materials.<br>
	<br>
	Practice is how I plan on improving in visual and electronic communication. Although, practice isn’t as simple as completing projects with these tools. It’s about experimenting with different tools and workflows and challenging myself to learn new things. I will continue to look for opportunities to apply these skills on projects and assignments which wouldn’t necessarily require them. By continuing this, I will be prepared to apply my strengths when I need them the most whether personally, academically, professionally.<br>
	Within written communication, delivery is one of my weaknesses. I often struggle to articulate my ideas, which this often becomes the most time-consuming aspect of my writing process. Additionally, I find it difficult to know when to restate my ideas and how within a paper. Delivery is an important aspect of written communication. The audience wouldn’t be able infer the intent of the words over their interpretation of the words.<br>
	<br>
	Throughout the semester I have employed strategies to mitigate this weakness; although, I plan to implement new strategies for the future. One strategy which I should have taken more advantage of was asking other for help. Delivery is often near the end of my writing process, which often made it difficult to find appropriate time to use these resources. For future assignments, I plan to commit more time in the beginning, so I have time to collaborate with peers, ask for help from instructors, and use the writing and media center.<br>
	<br>
	When appealing or considering audience, I often attempt to leverage my strengths. The main aspect which I consider while doing this are understanding precedent and background of the audience. Precedent is about understanding expectation of the audience: where might visuals be or not be appropriate, how much weight does this topic entail. While background considers how much prior experience or technical knowledge does the audience have. The strengths which I plan to utilize for future audiences are with electronic and visual communication.<br>
	<br>
	Both plans of improvement in communication revolve around time commitment. Although, the benefits of higher quality work and the opportunity to better appeal to audiences outweigh that cost.
