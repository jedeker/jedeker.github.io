				<h3>Assignment Revision</h3>
				<p>	Content wasn’t necessarily the weakness of the original submission, so instead of compiling the essay into an outline and rewriting the paper from there, I decide work off the original submission.<br>
				<br>
				The first goal in revising this assignment was to look for sentences which were wordy or had awkward phrasing. One of the tools I used for this was reading the paper loud. This immediately drew attention to sentences which were too long as well as sentences which were unnecessarily complex (which the reader might have to reread to capture the meaning). An example of this is in the third paragraph which originally stated, “One of the advantages of introducing an informal argument is the ease in which Greenfield is able to contribute their own experiences, perspectives, and opinions without changing the flow the essay,” now becomes “Through introducing an informal argument Greenfield contributes their own experiences, perspectives, and opinions without changing the flow the essay”.<br>
				<br>
				While the substance of the assignment had merit, abundant use of quotation broke up the flow of the essay. In certain spots, these have been replaced with paraphrasing; “Greenfield notes, ‘I spent some time in Louisiana and…’ (611) and ‘I live in San Diego now, and it seems to currently not be possible to support a meat-eating population’ (613)” was replaced by “For example, Greenfield notes, experiences from his time in Louisiana and San Diego (611, 613).”  Additionally, transition between paragraphs were adjust to further aid flow.</p>

				<h3>Revised Assignment</h3>
				<p>In “An Argument against Veganism . . . from a Vegan”, Rob Greenfield explains how the issue of veganism juxtaposed to meat consumption is more intricate than “a blanket statement for veganism” (Greenfield 611). Originally posted to the author’s online blog in 2015, the article is targeted toward the lower or middle class American. The article supports an environmentally friendly diet which Greenfield notes in the conclusion. Greenfield employs techniques which involve and consider the positions of reader to better support their argument. These techniques include using tone and diction to build a conversational attitude and a structure which acknowledges differing viewpoints.<br>
				<br>
				Through word choice and tone Greenfield builds a connection with the reader. Immediately, Greenfield sets the tone of the essay saying, “[P]lease take a deep breath and chill out for a second” (609). Directly referencing the reader provides an informal tone, creating a conversational quality. In addition, this adds a point of contrast, the idea that this piece is unique from the general discussion. By frequently using “I” the author assumes a more personal ownership of the essay. “I think”, “I believe”, and “I would argue” are all examples of phrases which maintain a calm and honest demeanor throughout the essay, reinforcing this idea from the beginning.<br>
				<br>
				Through introducing an informal argument Greenfield contributes their own experiences, perspectives, and opinions without changing the flow the essay. For example, Greenfield notes, experiences from his time in Louisiana and San Diego (611, 613). Additionally, Greenfield shares their own benefits in health and fitness. In more formal writing, either of these examples may be considered digressing or abrupt.
				Greenfield acknowledges the different sides of the issue, discussing advantages and disadvantages to make a logical argument which reduces bias favoring one side. The idea of two buckets, vegans and meat consumers, continues on page 610, where Greenfield highlights both the weaknesses of meat diets and weakness of vegan diets in succession. By balancing these ideas, Greenfield supports their opinion that neither meat eaters nor vegans are completely correct. As a further example of balancing, Greenfield states “Vegans should absolutely continue promoting vegan diets” (612) and in the next paragraph adds “One recommendation I would make to vegans and vegetarians is to be compassionate to all humans too, not just animals” (612). In the conclusion, Greenfield again acknowledges their audience, “We all have a unique situation, so doing what is right for you…” and restates the idea that veganism is not the absolute solution. Through acknowledging differing sides, Greenfield affirms ideas from a wider audience which improves the likelihood of the audience agreeing with Greenfield’s argument.<br>
				<br>
				Throughout the essay, Greenfield employs many techniques which build credibility. One example of this is “I want to be upfront that I utterly support veganism” (609); transparency and honesty builds trust from the audience. In addition, as Greenfield establishes themselves as a vegan, the audience would expect that a vegan would have a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the practice than otherwise. To build credibility in a different way, Greenfield provides a quote by Gandhi and introduces a different facet of the argument. An abstract moral idea that attempts to resonate with a different audience which Greenfield offers to demonstrate a deeper level of understand of the issue.<br>
				<br>
				By speaking to the audience openly from their own perspectives, Greenfield creates an argument which addresses the audience as they might a friend. Greenfield uses informal language, frequently using “I” statements and crafting sentences to be suggestions rather than supposing a more assertive tone. In addition, Greenfield openly acknowledges his own position in the matter which nets credibility. Through applying these techniques, Greenfield builds a connection with the reader creating a more effective and unique argument.</p>

				<h3>Original Assignment</h3>
				<p>In “An Argument against Veganism . . . from a Vegan”, Rob Greenfield explains how the issue of veganism juxtaposed to meat consumption is more intricate than “a blanket statement for veganism” (Greenfield 611). The article was originally posted to the author’s online blog in 2015 and is intended to influence the decisions of the audience regarding food purchase and consumption. Greenfield employs techniques which involve and consider the positions of reader to better support their argument. These techniques include using tone and diction to build a conversational attitude and a structure which acknowledges differing viewpoints.<br>

				Through word choice and tone Greenfield builds a connection with the reader.

In addition, this adds a point of contrast, the idea that this piece is unique from the general discussion. By frequently using “I” the author assumes a more personal ownership of the essay.

Additionally, Greenfield shares their own benefits in health and fitness. In more formal writing, either of these examples may be considered digressing or abrupt.<br>
				<br>
				Greenfield addresses this argument to two distinct audiences, “To the vegans reading this” and “To the meat eaters reading this”. This acknowledges the different sides of the issue. The idea of two buckets, vegans and meat consumers, continues on page 610, where Greenfield highlights both the weaknesses of meat diets and weakness of vegan diets in succession.
