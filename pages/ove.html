				<h3>Oral Communication</h3>
				<p>One of the ways that I have grown in oral communication was through improving speaking volume and tempo. The assignment which best demonstrated this was being the class discussion leader, with partner. We bounced ideas off each other, making sure that there wasn't a right answer for each question, and practiced communicating as a team.<br>
				<br>
				Practicing beforehand meant I didn't have to think on the fly, so I could focus on maintain an appropriate speaking volume and not speeding up. I prefaced our discussion questions and asked two of them. Many voices contributed to the conversation with many ideas and the discussion was very productive.<br>
				<br>
				Improving in oral communication and being articulate both allowed the discussion to be successful, as well as demonstrating my improvement in oral commination.</p>

					<h3>Visual Communication</h3>
					<p>Visuals are powerful and can convey certain meanings more effectively than words alone. With this in mind, I designed to presentation not simply to outline my main speaking points, but to be referred to when it's more efficient to explain something with pictures. This assignment helped understand how to use visual aid more effectively.<br>
					<br>
					This presentation was created using information from a research paper. To make the presentation more enjoyable for an audience I decided to include a story from my own experiences. I included images from that story, along with a map which demonstrated my main point.<br>
					<br>
					Including a story, helped ground my presentation making it more relatable and a more effective visual.</p>

				<h3>Electronic Communication</h3>
				<p>This portfolio provides perhaps the best example of my strengths with electronic communication. I created this website with the intention of challenging my front-end web development skills and fostering progress in electronic communication.<br>
				<br>
				This website was not created using website builders or templates. This website was instead created using a web development environment, Adobe Dreamweaver and other various software, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Visual Studio Code. The main advantage of this is complete control of all aspects of the design; although, this adds considerable overhead and it remains up to the developer to implement compatibility across platforms and accessibility.<br>
				<br>
				While coding this website, I drew upon previous experiences and general computer knowledge; although, many features of this website I learned how to implement solely for this website. This includes the short JavaScript animation on the Journal Revision and various CSS techniques.<br>
				<br>
				My goal for this portfolio was to make it unique and interesting. While not perfect, this portfolio demonstrates my strengths in electronic communication.
