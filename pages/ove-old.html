				<h4>Oral Communication</h4>
				<p>One of the ways that I have grown in oral communication was through improving speaking volume and tempo. The assignment which best demonstrated this was being the class discussion leader, with partner. We bounced ideas off each other, making sure that there wasn't a right answer for each question, and practiced communicating as a team.<br>
				<br>
				Practicing beforehand meant I didn't have to think on the fly, so I could focus on maintain an appropriate speaking volume and not speeding up. I prefaced our discussion questions and asked two of them. Many voices contributed to the conversation with many ideas and the discussion was very productive.<br>
				<br>
				Improving in oral communication and being articulate both allowed the discussion to be successful, as well as demonstrating my improvement in oral commination.</p>

				<h4>Visual Communication</h4>
				<p>Visuals are powerful and can convey certain meanings more effectively than words alone. With this in mind, I designed to presentation not simply to outline my main speaking points, but to be referred to when it's more efficient to explain something with pictures. This assignment helped understand how to use visual aid more effectively.<br>
				<br>
				This presentation was created using information from a research paper. To make the presentation more enjoyable for an audience I decided to include a story from my own experiences. I included images from that story, along with a map which demonstrated my main point.<br>
				<br>
				Including a story, helped ground my presentation making it more relatable and a more effective visual.</p>
