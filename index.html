            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Desmos graphing calculator is often used to create art, in addition to graphing
                and visualizing numerical data. Desmos art is displayed on the website and official
                contests have been held. The following instructions describe one process of creating
                art in Desmos.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the basic functionality of Desmos is inferred and a strong understanding
                of math (up to Algebra II) is recommended. The time requirement varies with each
                piece (see figures 2a, 2b, and 2c), although expect about 1 hour to learn and
                complete this process.

            <p>Choose and <span class="tooltip">upload<span class="content"><img src="res/upload.png"/></span></span> a reference image to Desmos.</p>
            <p class="note"><span class="note-type">Important:</span> The difficulty and time
                required greatly depend on the reference. Easier references focus on one subject
                with clearly defined shapes (figure 2a). More difficult references contain fine
                detail (figure 2b). Photo-realistic images are not recommended since shapes and
                colors may not have well defined borders (figure 2c).

            <h3 id="step-3">3. Building Equations</h3>
            <p>All paths can be approximated by lines and Bezier curves. Other equations may be used, but each require additional adaptation which is outside the scope of this guide.
                Polynomials, Splines, and Fourier Series are among the most powerful techniques to name a few.</p>
            <p>Experiment with the following equations to see how each work. Add any new points as
                needed so the points added in Step 2 may remain stationary. At the bottom of
                Step 3, an example graph is included to see the outcome of each equation.</p>
            <h4>Lines</h4>
            <p>The parametric equation which connects two points is as follows:</p><img height="32px" src="res/point-equation.PNG"/>
            <p>Copy-paste the following latex into Desmos: <code>\left(\left(c-a\right)t+a,\left(d-b\right)t+b\right)</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Replace the two <i>a</i>&#8217;s with the x-value of the starting point.</li>
                <li>Replace the the two <i>b</i>&#8217;s with the y-value of the starting point.</li>
                <li>Replace <i>c</i> with the y-value of the starting point.</li>
                <li>Replace <i>d</i> with the y-value of the starting point.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Polygons</h4>
            <p>Polgons are a fast, efficient way to draw shapes that contain no curves. In Desmos, the polygon function takes a list of x-values and a list of y-values for parameters.</p>
            <p>Copy-paste the following latex into Desmos: <code>\operatorname{polygon}\left(\left[\right],\left[\right]\right)</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type the x-values of the points, seperated by commas, in the first set of square brackets.</li>
                <li>Type the y-values of the points, seperated by commas, in the second set of square brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note"><span class="note-type">Important:</span> Make sure that the order of the points between the x and y values is the same.
            </p>
            <h4>Bezier Curves</h4>
            <p>Beziers can be used to approximate any curve.</p>
            <p>Copy-paste the following latex into Desmos: </p>
            <code>B\left(t,P\right)=\sum_{i=0}^{\operatorname{length}\left(P\right)-1} \operatorname{nCr}\left(\operatorname{length}\left(P\right)-1,i\right)\left(1-t\right)^{\operatorname{length}\left(P\right)-1-i}t^{i}P\left[i+1\right]</code>
            <p>This statement only needs to appear once on the equation list. The function will allow you to more easily draw Bezier Curves.</p>
            <p>Copy-paste the following latex into Desmos: <code>\left(B_{ezier}\left(t,\left[\right]\right),B_{ezier}\left(t,\left[\right]\right)\right)</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type the x-values of the points, seperated by commas, in the first set of square brackets.</li>
                <li>Type the y-values of the points, seperated by commas, in the second set of square brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note"><span class="note-type">Tip:</span> Moving points on a Bezier curve changes the entire curve, adding more points will cause the amount of influence on sections farther away to decrease.</p>

            <h3 id="step-4">4. Outlining Shapes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the shape contains only lines, use the polygon function to draw the shape. Otherwise, proceed with the following steps.</li>
                <li>Designate a starting point on the shape or stroke.</li>
                <li>If the current shape borders another previously drawn shape, proceed in the opposite direction. (If you drew the previous shape in the clockwise direction, draw the new shape in the counter-clockwise direction and vice versa.)</li>
                <li>Identify the next point in the sequence.</li>
                <li>Draw the appropriate line or curve to the next point.</li>
                <li>If the line or curve already exists, copy and paste the previous equation.</li>
                <li>Then if the previous line or curve was <i>not</i> drawn in the opposite direction, reverse the order of the points in the equation.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 4-7 until the entire shape or stroke is drawn.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For each point, if all the shapes which use that point have been drawn, lock the value in place.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the x-value of the point.</li>
                <li>Paste the value wherever the x-variable appears (i.e. x₀ becomes 3.5).</li>
                <li>Copy the y-value of the point.</li>
                <li>Paste the value wherever the y-variable appears (i.e. y₀ becomes -2.8).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat sections 2 (Planning a Reference) and 4 (Outlining Shapes) for the remaining shapes and arcs in the reference image.</p>

            <h3 id="step-5">5. Filling and Coloring</h3>
            <p>Desmos supports two main color models: RGB and HSV.</p>
            <p>See <a href="https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406795899533-Custom-Colors">Desmos Help</a> for more information on creating colors.</p>
            <p>To fill in shapes, we need to turn the lines and arcs into piecewise functions.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Designate a shape.</li>
                <li>Copy-paste the following latex into Desmos: <code>\left(\left\{t<1:\right\},\left\{t<1:\right\}\right)</code></li>
                <li>Designate a starting line or curve.</li>
                <li>Copy the x-component of line or curve into the equation from Step 2 after the first colon.</li>
                <li>Copy the y-component of line or curve into the equation from Step 2 after the second colon. (At this point, your line or arc should appear.)</li>
                <li>Count the number of lines and curves in the shape.</li>
                <li>Set the <span class="tooltip">maximum<span class="content"><img src="res/domain.png"/></span></span> of the domain of <i>t</i> to the number of lines and curves.</li>
                <li>Type <code>,t<2:</code>after the copied equation from Step 4.</li>
                <li>Copy the x-component of the next line or curve after the colon from the previous step.</li>
                <li>Identify all occurence of <i>t</i> introduced by the previous step.</li>
                <li>Replace the occurences with <code>\left(t-1\right)</code>.</li>
                <li>Type <code>,t<2:</code>after the copied equation from Step 5.</li>
                <li>Copy the y-component of the next line or curve after the colon from the previous step.</li>
                <li>Identify all occurence of <i>t</i> introduced by the previous step.</li>
                <li>Replace the occurences with <code>\left(t-1\right)</code>.</li>
                <li>If you shape contains more equations, repeat steps 8-15 with the following modifications.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increment the 2 in Steps 8 and 12 by one each time.</li>
                    <li>Increment the 1 in Steps 11 and 15 by one each time.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Enable <span class="tooltip">fill<span class="content"><img src="res/fill.png"/></span></span> for the shape.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat the above process for each shape.</p>
