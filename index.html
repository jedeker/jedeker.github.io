				<p>My initial expectations for this semester in English 250 ended up completely different from what transpired. Putting aside health issues, looking back on Assignment One, I had a much narrower perspective on communication. Within written, oral, visual and electronic communication there were specific aspects which I wanted to focus on improving (i.e. mechanics, vocabulary, aesthetics); although, my improvement this semester has been about changing my approach to writing and integrating different ideas across the different forms of communication. My writing process has changed considerably throughout the semester.<br>
				<br>
				Initially, my writing process was much less defined. For the first few assignments, it varied assignment to assignment: sometimes more organized, sometimes rewriting successive drafts. As I progressed, I found that organizing information and ideas on paper first was much more efficient. Especially since, I often get stuck on phrasing and diction. From there I would construct an outline, then finally complete a draft. Solidifying my writing process has improved my skills as a writer as well as improving the quality of my first drafts. Throughout the semester, I have utilized technology to augment my writing both in and outside this class. Specifically, for this class I have used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for Assignments 4, 5, and 6. Additionally, this website is the most significant example of my use of technology, as it was coded entirely in Adobe Dreamweaver without any use of templates. There are other opportunities that aren’t always obvious candidates, such as email communication and PowerPoints. Applying technology has strengthened my communication as well as made it more interesting.</p>

				One component to this class which surprised me was how helpful working with peers was. During peer review sessions, what I found the most helpful was reading other students’ papers sometimes provided additional context or clarification and new perspectives or ideas. With the sessions also catching grammatical mistakes and formatting issues. Another example is working in groups for class discussion leaders and Assignments 5. These experiences have made me reconsider the solo approach to writing that I developed in high school.<br>
				<br>
				How I improved as a communicator over the semester is vastly different from my expectations entering this course. My improvement has been more robust that I expected with improvements in my writing process, familiarity with using technology, and a new perspective on working with my peers.</p>
